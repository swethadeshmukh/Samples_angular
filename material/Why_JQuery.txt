Does Angular use the jQuery library?
Yes, Angular can use jQuery if it's present in your app when the application is being bootstrapped. If jQuery is not present in your script path, Angular falls back to its own implementation of the subset of jQuery that we call jQLite.

Angular 1.3 only supports jQuery 2.1 or above. jQuery 1.7 and newer might work correctly with Angular but we don't guarantee that.


What is jqLite?
jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way.jqLite implements only the most commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.

To use jQuery, simply ensure it is loaded before the angular.js file.
