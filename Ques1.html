The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. The jQuery library contains the following features: HTML/DOM manipulation, CSS manipulation, HTML event methods, Effects and animations, AJAX, Utilities');

<h1 id="h1">DOES Angular Js Use a JQuery library</h1>

<p>Yes, Angular can use jQuery if it's present in your app when the application is being bootstrapped. If 

jQuery is not present in your script path, Angular falls back to its own implementation of the subset of 

jQuery that we call jQLite.

Angular 1.3 only supports jQuery 2.1 or above. jQuery 1.7 and newer might work correctly with Angular 

but we don't guarantee that.
